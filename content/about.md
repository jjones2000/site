My name is Joseph Jones. I am a Theoretical Physics PhD student at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). 

Currently I research statistical mechanics and phase transitions. I have a passive interest in the financial markets, investment strategies and current global affairs.
